#Changelog

## 1.1.2 (2020-05-14)

### Cleanup
  - remove lodash as a dependency


## 1.1.1 (2020-04-03)

### Features:
  - nedb does not expose any API to close a Datastore, so that the close didn't do anything. Implemented precautions to
     - persist cached database & compact (done via persistCachedDatabase);
     - stop further compactions (done via stopAutocompaction);
     - remove references to datastores so that they cannot be used without being re-loaded.

### Cleanup: 
 - bump `dependencies` & `devDependencies`;

### Bug fixes:
  - a call to `save` in nedbclient would only `$set` the additions using nedb's modifiers (https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb#updating-documents), now it saves the whole document again.
  - migrations now allow to rename a field without leaving the old field lying in the Datastore


## 1.1.0 (2019-09-04)

### Features:
 - add way to give custom nedb options to `nedbclient`  to match `reactlocalmongoclient` signature;
 - add a `readOnly` option to `nedbclient`;

### Cleanup: 
 - _asyncify_ all functions in `nedbclient`;
 - convert `that` to `this` in `nedbclient` by switching to arrow functions;
 - switch `.gitlab-ci.yml` to `node:10` instead of `node:latest`;
 - convert useless `let` to `const` in `nedbclient`;
 - bump `devDependencies`;

### Bug fixes:
 - fix bug in `dropDatabase` when not in memory which would crash when removing file (because of a `this` improperly used inside of a `function`);
 
 
## 1.0.3 (2019-04-19)

### Features:
 - add a way to give custom `react-native-nedb` options to `reactlocalmongoclient` such as `AsyncStorage`


## 1.0.2 (2018-06-15)

### Bug fixes:
 - added default empty queries to `mongoclient`.


## 1.0.1 (2018-06-04)

### Features:
 - **[BREAKING]** dynamically connect to a database rather than a static connection (mostly to improve testing) with a factory function pattern;
 - added migrations
 - **[BREAKING]** changed how the collections are stored with NeDB: rather than giving a file path, a directory path is given and the name of each collection is given by the name of the class;
